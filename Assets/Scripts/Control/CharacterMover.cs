Author:         Tanner Hunt
Date:           5/12/2024
Version:        2.0.0
Description:    This Code interfaces with the Character Controller component and handles
                basic character movement, like walking, strafing, and jumping.  Now also
                creates velocity events on the player, like being catapulted from the sling
                shot or changing the direction the player jumps if they are clinging to a wall.
ChangeLog:      
                V 1.1.0 5/8/2024
                    --expanded functionality of jump function so it now can specify a direction
                    vector.
                    --Player input will now reduce velocity on the x and z axis
                    --NYI: merge jump and addmomentum?
                V 1.2.0 5/10/2024
                    --gravity now scales up after the player reaches the max jump height
                    --NYI: player overshoots and clips into the terrain while following
                    --NYI: isJumping is redundant to character state
                    --NYI: This class has taken on too much responsibility.  Tease out vertical movement
                    and momentum from this class.
                V 2.0.0 -- 5/12/2024
                    --Refactored code and removed responsibility of jumping and other velocity 
                    events from this class
                    --removed magnitude helper function in favor of built-in funcitonality
                    --removed player velocity from this class, it is now referenced from the
                    characterstate class
                    --move stays in this class.  the velocityEvents class also changes the
                    velocity that this method call references, but shouldn't be in both classes.
                    It seems more appropriate for it to be called here.
                    --Player now accelerates while they run, up to a maximum speed
